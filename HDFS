Haddop stores data in HDFS.

HDFS has a master-slave architecture. The master node is the NameNode, which manages over multiple slave notdes, known as DataNodes.

    - DataNodes
        DataNodes store actual physical data in the form of chunks in the blocks assigned by the NameNode. The default setting ensure each data block has three replicas.
    - NameNode
        Namenode keeps the information of blocks like number of blocks, their replicas, and other details.
